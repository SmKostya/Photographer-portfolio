            Hello! I'm Kostya Smirnov, 4 year student of KNTU. My drem/goal in life to works as
            a frontend developer. I like to create sites that are useful for people, combining 
            the useful with the pleasant. At the university i study energy and non-traditional 
            energy sources, such as solar panels and windmills, it’s already difficult to call 
            them non-traditional, but this is the name of the specialty :)<br>
            This direction is not very interesting to me, so after the end of the 4th year, 
            i want to get a higher education programmer. <br>I began to study programming at the 
            physical and technical lyceum. There was a free C # course that really interested me, 
            i learned how to create simple desktop applications and it was very cool. 
            In computer science classes, we also learned the basics of HTML and CSS, but it wasn’t 
            so interesting :) <br> While studying at the university, i also tried to develop mobile 
            applications, but most of all I liked the development of sites.
